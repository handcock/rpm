\title{Modeling of Revealed Preferences Matchings}
\description{
An integrated set of tools to fit a revealed preference model
for men and women of certain
characteristics (or shared characteristics) of people of the opposite sex.
The model assumes a one-to-one stable matching using an observed set of
matchings and a set of (possibly dyadic) covariates to 
estimate the parameters for
linear equations of utilities.
It does this using an approximate likelihood based on ideas from Menzel (2015).
The "rpm" packages is part of
the "statnet" suite of packages for the analysis of social network 
data.  For a list of functions type:
help(package='rpm')
