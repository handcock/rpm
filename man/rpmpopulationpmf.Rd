\description{
\code{\link{rpmpopulationpmf}} computes the probability mass function for a population of the pairs and singles
from a Revealed Preference Matchings Model based on arbitary availability distribution and 
preferences. It is typically based on the estimate from a \code{rpm()} call.
}
\details{
The function \code{\link{rpm}} is used to fit a revealed preference model
for men and women of certain
characteristics (or shared characteristics) of people of the opposite sex.
The model assumes a one-to-one stable matching using an observed set of
matchings and a set of (possibly dyadic) covariates to 
estimate the parameters for
linear equations of utilities.
It does this using an large-population likelihood based on ideas from Dagsvik (2000), Menzel (2015) and Goyal et al (2023).

The model represents the dyadic utility functions as deterministic linear utility functions of
dyadic variables. These utility functions are functions of observed characteristics of the women
and men.
These functions are entered as terms in the function call
to \code{\link{rpm}}. This function simulates from such a model.
