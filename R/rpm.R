#' Fit a Revealed Preference Matchings Model
#' 
#' \code{\link{rpm}} estimates the parameters of a revealed preference model
#' for men and women of certain
#' characteristics (or shared characteristics) of people of the opposite sex.
#' The model assumes a one-to-one stable matching using an observed set of
#' matchings and a set of (possibly dyadic) covariates to 
#' estimate the parameters for
#' linear equations of utilities.
#' It does this using an large-population likelihood based on ideas from Menzel (2015) and Goyal et al (2023).
#' 
#' @aliases rpm.object
#' @param formula formula; an \code{\link{formula}} object, of the form \code{
#' ~ <model terms>}. For the details on the possible \code{<model terms>}, see
#' \code{\link{rpm-terms}}.
#' @param Xdata data.frame for women. Each row is a woman, each column is a variable on that women
#' or her partnerships. It must contain the women's ID variable (see \code{Xid}) and
#' a variable with the ID of the women's partner. If the women is single the men's ID should be NA.
#' @param Zdata data.frame for men. Each row is a man, each column is a variable on that men
#' It must contain the men's ID variable (see \code{Zid}).
#' @param Xid string The name of the variable in \code{Xdata} containing the IDs of the women.
#' @param Zid string The name of the variable in \code{Zdata} containing the IDs of the men.
#' @param pair_id string The name of the variable in \code{Xdata} containing the ID of the men paired with the women in
#' \code{Xid}. If the women is not paired it must be NA.
#' @param X_w string The name of the variable in \code{Xdata} containing the individual weight of the women.
#' If this is NULL then it is assumed the sample is unweighted from a population with 2000 women in it.
#' @param Z_w string The name of the variable in \code{Zdata} containing the individual weight of the man
#' If this is NULL then it is assumed the sample is unweighted from a population with 2000 men in it.
#' @param pair_w string The name of the variable in \code{Xdata} containing the pair weight of that women.
#' If the women is not paired it should be NA.
#' If this is NULL then it is computed from the individual weights using the \code{sampling_design}.
#' Note that the pair weights currently do not play a role in the estimation. They do in the quasi-likelihood version of the code.
##' If this is NULL then it is assumed the sample is unweighted from a population with 2000 men in it.
#' @param sampled string The name of the logical variable in \code{Xdata} and \code{Zdata} containing the 
#' indicator that the person was sampled directly (as distinct from being included as the match of a directly sampled
#' person. All single people are directly sampled. 
#' @param sampling_design string; The name of the sampling protocol used to select the survey data. Valid values are
#' \code{"stock-flow"} (default) (individuals are sampled, data contains both
#' singles and couples);
#' \code{"stock-stock"} (households are sampled, each household can be a single or a couple);
#' \code{"census"} (the sample is a census of the population of people).
## (only couples are included in the data).
#' @param control A list of control parameters for algorithm tuning. Constructed using
#' \code{\link{control.rpm}}, which should be consulted for specifics. 
#' @param verbose logical; if this is \code{TRUE}, the program will print out
#' additional information, including data summary statistics.
#' @details The pairings are determined by the \code{pair_id} variable in \code{Xdata}. 
#' If that variable is NA then the women is
#' assumed to be single. If men are listed in \code{Zdata} and are not partnered then they are assumed single.
#' Weights are specified by three optional variables in \code{Xdata}.
#' \itemize{
#' \item{X_w}{This is character string of the name of the weight variable for women. The sum of the weights should be the
#' number of women in the population.}
#' \item{Z_w}{This is character string of the name of the weight variable for men. The sum of the weights should be the
#' number of men in the population.}
#' \item{pair_w}{This is character string of the name of the weight variable for pairs.}
#' }
#' @return \code{\link{rpm}} returns an object of class \code{\link{rpm.object}}
#' that is a list consisting of the following elements: 
#' \item{coef}{The maximum psuedo-likelihood estimate of \eqn{\theta}, the vector of
#' coefficients for the model parameters. This includes the model \eqn{\beta} and the model \eqn{\Gamma}.}
#' \item{coefficients}{The bias-corrected bootstrap estimate of \eqn{\theta}, the vector of
#' coefficients for the model parameters. This includes the model \eqn{\beta} and the model \eqn{\Gamma}.}
#' \item{loglik}{The value of the maximized log-likelihood.}
#' \item{exitflag}{integer value with the status of the optimization (4 is success as 
#' \code{xtol_rel} or \code{xtol_abs} was reached). Other codes are 1 = generic success; 2 = optimization stopped because 
#' \code{ftol_rel} or \code{ftol_abs} was reached; 3 = optimization stopped 
#' because \code{stopval} was reached; 4 = optimization stopped because \code{xtol_rel} or \code{xtol_abs} was reached; 
#' 5 = optimization stopped because
#' \code{maxeval} was reached; 6 = optimization stopped because \code{maxtime} was reached.}
#' \item{call}{the call that was made to \code{nloptr}.}
#' \item{x0}{vector with starting values for the optimization.}
#' \item{message}{more informative message with the status of the optimization.}
#' \item{iterations}{number of iterations that were executed.}
#' \item{objective}{value if the objective function in the solution.}

#' \item{version}{version of NLopt that was used.}
#' \item{covar}{Approximate covariance matrix of the estimates.}
#' \item{eq}{Values from the equality constraints. Larger values indicate non-convergence.}
